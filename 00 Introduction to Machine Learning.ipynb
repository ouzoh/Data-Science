    "* **Machine Learning** is a _method of data analysis_ that ***automates analytical model building***\n",
    "* Machine learning uses algorithms that **iteratively learn from data**\n",
    "* Machine learning allows computers to **find hidden insights** _without bring explicitly programmed_ where to look\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning process essentially boils to to iterating until model fits test/sample data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 3 main types of Machine Learning algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "    * You have labeled data are are trying to predict a label off of known features\n",
    "2. **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "    * You have unlabeled data and are trying to group together similar data point based off other features\n",
    "3. **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "    * Algorithm learns to perform an action from experience\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Supervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Through methods like classification, regression, prediction and gradient boosting, supervised learning uses patterns to predict the values of the label on additional unlabeled data\n",
    "\n",
    "Commonly used in applications where historic data likely predict future events\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, anticipate when a credit card transactions are likely to be fraudulent or which insurance customer is likely to file a claim or predict price of a house based on different features for houses for which we have historical price data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Unsupervised Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "No historical labels i.e. **unlabelled data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The system is not told what the \"right answer\" is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm musyt figure out what is being shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is often to explore the data and find some structure/pattern within or **find the main attributes that separate customer segments from each other**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular techniques include self-organising maps, nearest neighbor mapping, k-means clustering and singular value decomposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithms can also be used to segment text topics, recommend items and identify data outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reinforcement Learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "Often used for robotics, gaming and navigation\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm discovers through trial and error which actions yield the greatest rewards\n",
    "\n",
    "Has 3 primary components:\n",
    "1. The agent (the leaner or decision maker)\n",
    "2. The environment (everything the agent interacts with)\n",
    "3. Actions (what agent can do)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: choose actions that maximize the expected reward over a given amount of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The agent will reach the goal faster by following a good policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: To learn the best policy\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scikit-Learn Process\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Every algorithm is exposed in scikit-learn via an **\"Estimator\"** object\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **First you will import the model, the general form is:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.family import Model\n",

    "  _For example_\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "LinearRegression is the estimator here.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Set your Estimator parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model = LinearRegression(normalize=True)\n",
    "print (model)\n",
    "\n",
    "ouput:\n",
    "LinearRegression(copy_X=True, fit_intercept=True, normalize=True)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Train and Fit model to data**\n",
    "\n",
    "It is good practise to split data into a **training** and **test** sets \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.fit(X_train,y_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train are the features\n",
    "y_train are the training labels\n",
    "\n",
    "For **unsupervised learning** applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.fit(X_train)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Predict labels or values**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is often for the ***Supervised Learning***. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictions=model.predict(X_test)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Also available is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictions=model.predict_proba()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Returns the probability that a new observation has each categorical label. In this case, label with highest probability is returned by model.predict()\n",
    "\n",
    "Also available\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictions=model.score()\n",
    "```\n",
    "Scores are between 0 and 1. With larger score indicating a better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unsupervised learning** will be slightly different.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.transform()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "model.fit_transform()\n",
    "```\n",
    "some estimators implement this method, efficiently performs a fit and a transform on the same input data\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an unsupervised model, transform new data into the new basis. Accepts one argument and returns new representation of data based on the unsupervised model.\n",
