    "### Parametric Methods\n",
    "Parametric methods involve a two-step model-based approach.\n",
    "1. First, we make an assumption about the functional form, or shape, of f. For example, a linear model\n",
    "2. After a model has been selected, we need a procedure that uses the training data to fit or train the model. For example,(ordinary) least squares. \n",
    "The model-based approach just described is referred to as parametric; it reduces the problem of estimating f down to one of estimating a set of parameters.\n",
